## github doesn't like it when i put the secret key on here

so create a file in backend/backend called .env and you'll wanna put

```python
SECRET_KEY = ''
```

and text me for it, then put it in there and everything should work

# logging in

if you go to /admin after running the server login with these or maybe we can create another user

username: ajmorgan

password: password

from here we can see the users we make, it'll print name -- email
